# Portfolio page
- Used gsap, locomotivejs, vanilla javascript, css animations for the interactive part. Rest of the layout was created with grid, flex, display & z-index properties.
- For the overall design, I slightly modified the exisiting design of obys homepage. This includes, adding some elements, colours, gradients & freely available fonts.
- I have tried my best to make it as responsive as possible but due to so many elements, some things may appear ugly on smaller screens so please open the website on a full desktop browser window.
- If you have any suggestions, do share in my inbox :)
